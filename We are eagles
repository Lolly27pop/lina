an inspirator once told me about a story that is very, very makes me so excited and optimistic. 
it is a story about "we are the eagle of the opponent". which is the story as follows; 
once an eagle egg strayed in the place of a chicken egg. a swing and occupy it until one day hatch. 
and eagle eggs hatch along with chicken eggs. all his life the eagle did not know about his identity. 
he crowed, pecked like a chicken and could not fly. Yes, He was very surprised to see another eagle that flew dashing over him,
and said to his chicken brother "look if we were like an eagle, we would be very cool."
and finally all his life he lived and died as a chicken.
